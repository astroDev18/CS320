# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
We can ensure that our code is secure by using software testing, which is an important part of software development. This can allow us to verifiably check that our code
is functional and outputting the results we are expecting.
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
We can interperet user needs by writing out user stories and then breaking down their problem and implementing it step by step into our program.
This can improve effeciency and make it easier for us to develop. It can also help us make sure we are adding what the user really needs into our program.
# How do I approach designing software?
We can approach designing software by starting with the basics and then moving forward. It is often important to use a "black box" method, where we
hide the detailed implementation and just focus on the overall problem. By doing so we can build in a top-down structure and improve our effeciency.
